			imagine you were an alien that arrived to ireland via ufo on a monday morning.<br><br><br>
		you might gaze in wonder at the many humans leaving
		one box and going to a different box - often by means of a third box.

<br><br><br>
you learn that the first two boxes are called "home" and "work" and that the 
journey between each is called "commuting". <br><br><br>

you decide to examine these commuters more closely.

<!-- 
in ireland, recent census results showed that more people are doing this than ever
and the average time spent doing so rose to 29.1 minutes in 2022.


<br><br>

what you might find particularly strange is that this had all changed a few 
years ago. a pandemic meant that offices were closed
and companies realised that many jobs could now be worked remotely.

<br><br>

but, you gather, something has changed. 
employees are being ordered back to the 
office for a number of reasons that seem pretty vague.  -->
